For trees like:

PATH_EXPR@35..44
      PATH@35..44
        PATH_SEGMENT@35..44
          NAME_REF@35..44
            IDENT@35..44 "rigthhand"

an expression metavar will be matched two times,
one for PATH_EXPR and one for NAME_REF, this is because
the Rnode visitor(visitrnode) has no clue about what happened before it.
It only has the environments before it. 

So for expression exp; this is going to produce two different bindings:

Env1
exp => righthand//type PATH_EXPR

Env2
exp => righthand//type NAME_REF

This will not cause a problem in matching or removing, but it is something
worth noting.
